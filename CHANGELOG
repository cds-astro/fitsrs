# CHANGELOG.md

## 0.4.0-beta

- Create a workspace to accept sub-crates
- Add a CLI tool in the workspace
- Add a few getters in header structs
- Add HIERACH support

## 0.3.0

Features:

- Provide an iterator over the HDU list
- #16: Parsing of comments, history, continued, card as enum.
- #20 Basic support of Bintable
- #20 Faster parsing using the benefit of the Seek trait to skip data block not wanted
- Seek to a specific pixel in the ImageData struct
- Possibility to access the raw bytes of a binary table for cursor typed readers
- Fits is cloneable as long as the provided reader is cloneable
- #20 Tiled image convention for storing compressed images in FITS binary tables
    * Compression supported, GZIP, GZIP2 and RICE on u8, i16, i32 and f32. H_compress and PLI0 are not supported
    * Dithering techniques for floating point texture not well tested (test samples are welcome)
    * `NULL_PIXEL_MASK` column and `ZMASKCMP` keyword is not supported

Breaking changes:

- The iterator over HDUs is more rust idiomatic but introduces a different usage of the API
- `Header.get` method now takes a `&str` instead of a `[u8; 8]` slice.

Bugfixes:

- Be more safe about UB [https://github.com/cds-astro/fitsrs/issues/5]. BITPIX > 8 needs to be read from BigEndian scheme. It is thus necessary to create a new owned vector from the reading bytes. For BITPIX = 8, data can be directly read from the memory without allocating anything.
